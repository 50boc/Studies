# Getting Started with Ansible
## Intro
I'm using [Ansible for Devops][ab140a78]  to get started with Ansible. This book was recommended by Amaozon "Patrik J. Kerpan" as a good book to learn by doing. He further stated that each of the example provide value on how you use this framework for real world purposes.

In this lab I will get started with Ansile by first orchestrate some AWS EC2 server. Then I will use vagrant to start up a Centos 7 server.
## Overview
### What is Ansible
- Simple automation languange that describe an IT application infrastructure.
- Automation engine that runs Ansible playbooks
- Ansible tower is an enterprise framework for controlling, securing, and managing your Ansible automation with a UI and restful API.

## Details
### Getting Started with Ansible
I am using Ubuntu 16.04. I first started by installing Ansible with this commands.
`sudo  apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install -y ansible `

Now let's use Ansible to connect to an AWS server. I had already created an EC2 instance therefore I will not showcase that process. But In order to get access to my EC2 through SSH I had to go through some loophole.
1. First I had to create a ssh rsa key pair on my local machine `ssh-keygen -t rsa` this created â€œ~/.ssh/id_rsa" and "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
2. Now login on the aws server through ssh I was able to tun the following commands.`useradd -m <yourname> ` `sudo su <yourname>` `cd ` `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` `touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` `chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh` `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*`
3. The I uploaded my local ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the server and passed it to the new authorized_keys files that I created `cat id_rsa.pub  > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
4. Login for Ansible was accepted after that.
